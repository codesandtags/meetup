# Meetup Event Planner

> Project #1 of the [Senior Software Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd802) by **Google** and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.
